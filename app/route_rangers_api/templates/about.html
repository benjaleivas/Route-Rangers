  <p class="inline" style="color: #464444;">
    We are "Route Rangers", a team of UChicago Computer Science and Public Policy students committed to
    revitalizing public interest and participation in transit systems. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, ridership levels
    have plummeted across the United States. This decline in ridership levels has led to service cuts, further
    discouraging ridership and posing a significant challenge for cities striving to recover.
  </p>
  <p class="inline" style="color: #464444;">
    Our mission is to address this critical issue by creating a platform that bridges the gap between policymakers and
    the public. We believe providing a space for current and potential transit users to voice their ideas and feedback
    is essential.
  </p>

  <h6 style="color: #07063A;">Our Goal:</h6>
  <p class="inline" style="color: #464444;">
    We aim to empower urban transit policymakers with data analytics and public feedback to inform and enhance transit
    planning. We aim to improve the overall transit ecosystem by fostering this connection and encouraging greater
    ridership.
